			%p{style:"font-weight:bold;"} This platform has been developed as an incubator for a number of linked datasets of value to the International Development community.
			%p It currently hosts data from:
			%ul
				%li <a href="http://r4d.dfid.gov.uk/">Research for Development</a>
				%li <a href="http://www.eldis.org/">ELDIS</a>
			%p And draws upon a number of other key datasets. There are three ways to access the data here:
			%ul
				%li Via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL">SPARQL</a> - the query language for linked data
				%li By dereferencing selected URIs - giving access to human and machine-readable data
				%li Via a simple API (coming soon) - based on the IDS API for accessing data on publications

			%h3 Why linked data?
			%p Linked data is an approach to publishing data on the web. Linked data uses URIs to identify entities in a dataset, and returns machine-readable data when those URIs are looked up (dereferenced). When different datasets use shared identifiers to represent items and properties then it becomes easier to combine datasets from difference sources.
			%p Unlike conventional databases or spreadsheet formats, which constrain how data can be represented, forcing it into columns, rows and pre-defined schema, linked data uses a graph structure to represent data, making it very extensible. That means that when data is brought together from different sources it does not have to adopt a lowest common denominator approach to data integration, but allows flexibility in how data is stored and combined.

			%h3 Who are we?
			%p The Linked Development project is supported by Research for Development and carried out by Practical Participation. Questions can be directed to tim@practicalparticipation.co.uk.
			%p Code for the Linked Development platform can be found on GitHub.
			%p The platform recently migrated to <a href="http://swirrl.com/">Swirrl's</a> <a href="http://swirrl.com/publishmydata">Publish My Data</a> platform.
